Installing Elasticsearch

#To begin the process of installing Elasticsearch, add the following repository key:
wget -qO - https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch | sudo apt-key add -

#Install the apt-transport-https package:
sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https

#Add the following Elasticsearch list to the key:
echo "deb https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/7.x/apt stable main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elastic-7.x.list

#To install a version of Elasticsearch that contains only features licensed under Apache 2.0, use:
echo "deb https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/oss-7.x/apt stable main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elastic-7.x.list

#Update your system and install Elasticsearch with:
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install elasticsearch

#Open the Elasticsearch configuration file at: 
/etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml, and apply the following configurations:

network.host: "localhost"
http.port: 9200
cluster.initial_master_nodes: ["<PrivateIP"]

#Start the Elasticsearch service:
sudo service elasticsearch start

#Verify the installation by cURLing:
sudo curl http://localhost:9200

#If the output is similar to this, then you will know that Elasticsearch is running properly:
{ 
"name" : "ip-172-31-49-60", 
"cluster_name" : "elasticsearch", 
"cluster_uuid" : "yP0uMKA6QmCsXQon-rxawQ", 
"version" : 
{   
"number" : "7.0.0",   
"build_flavor" : "default",   
"build_type" : "deb",   
"build_hash" : "b7e28a7",   
"build_date" : "2019-04-05T22:55:32.697037Z",   
"build_snapshot" : false,   
"lucene_version" : "8.0.0",   
"minimum_wire_compatibility_version" : "6.7.0",   
"minimum_index_compatibility_version" : "6.0.0-beta1" }, 
"tagline" : "You Know, for Search"
}

#To make the service start on boot run:
sudo update-rc.d elasticsearch defaults 95 10

Note:-  Production tip: DO NOT open any other ports, like 9200, to the world! 
There are many bots that search for 9200 and execute groovy scripts to overtake machines. 
DO NOT bind Elasticsearch to a public IP.
