Installing Kibana

Kibana is an open-source data visualization plugin for Elasticsearch. 
It provides visualization capabilities on top of the content indexed on an Elasticsearch cluster. 
Users can create bar, line, and scatter plots; pie charts; and maps on top of large volumes of data.

Among other uses, Kibana makes working with logs super easy and even fun, and its graphical web interface lets beginners execute powerful log searches.

#To install Kibana, use this command:
sudo apt-get install kibana

#Open the Kibana configuration file and enter the following configurations:
sudo vim /etc/kibana/kibana.yml

server.port: 5601
server.host: "localhost"
elasticsearch.hosts: ["http://localhost:9200"]

#Start Kibana:
sudo service kibana start

#Test:
Point your browser to ‘http://YOUR_ELASTIC_IP:5601’ after Kibana is started (this may take a few minutes).

#Your next step in Kibana is to define an Elasticsearch index pattern.

What does an “index pattern” mean, and why do we have to configure it? 
Logstash creates a new Elasticsearch index (database) every day. 
The names of the indices look like this: logstash-YYYY.MM.DD
for example, “logstash-2020.10.05” for the index we created above on October 05, 2020.

Kibana works on top of these Elasticsearch indices, so it needs to know which one you want to use. 
Go to Management -> Kibana Index Patterns. 
Kibana automatically identifies the Logstash index, so all you have to do is define it with ‘logstash-*:

In the next step, we will select the @timestamp timestamp field, and then click the “Create index pattern” button to define the pattern in Kibana.

Note :- Production tip: In this tutorial, we are accessing Kibana directly through its application server on port 5601, but in a production environment 
you might want to put a reverse proxy server, like Nginx, in front of it.
